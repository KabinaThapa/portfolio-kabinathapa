    <h1>About Me: Unveiling My Journey</h1>
    <p>Greetings! I'm Kabina Thapa, 
       Allow me to share a bit about the journey that brought me to where I am today.</p>
    <h1>Venturing into the unknown</h1>
    <p>In 2017, I embarked on a life-changing journey, leaving the comfort of my home country to pursue my dreams in the United States. As an international student with a burning desire to delve into the world of technology, I chose to study Computer Science. 
      It wasn't merely a choice of career; it was a bold step to challenge norms and break barriers.</p>
      <h1> Breaking Stereotypes</h1>
      <p>Back in my homeland, the percentage of women pursuing technology was minimal. Motivated by a desire to change this narrative, 
        I set out on a mission to be a trailblazer. I knew that by immersing myself in the world of computer science, 
        I could inspire other young women to follow their passion and embrace the possibilities within the tech realm.</p>
        <h1>Educational Milestones</h1>
        <p>Fast forward to today, I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Queens College/CUNY, a testament to my dedication and hard work. Additionally, I earned an Associate degree in Computer Science from Fiorello H. LaGuardia Community College/CUNY. 
          My academic journey has equipped me with the skills and knowledge needed to excel in the dynamic field of technology.</p>
          <h1>Beyond Code: Unleashing Creativity</h1>
          <p>Beyond the world of coding, I find solace in the realm of 3D art painting during my free time. This creative outlet allows me to express myself, 
            adding a vibrant and artistic dimension to my skill set.</p>
            <h1>Looking Ahead</h1>
            <p>Now, as I stand at the threshold of my career, I am eager to contribute my skills and enthusiasm to a dynamic team. I bring not only technical prowess but also a unique perspective shaped by my diverse experiences.
              Join me on this exciting journey of innovation and transformation. Let's build something extraordinary together!</p>
